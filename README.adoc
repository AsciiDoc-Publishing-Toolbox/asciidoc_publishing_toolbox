== About the Project

ADPT (AsciiDoc Publishing Toolbox) is a simple publishing tool based on
AsciiDoc.

The goal is to create a tool with an interface that's similar to the one saw in
various package managers (like Node's `npm` or PHP's `composer`) specialized in
the creation, management and publishing of documents.
