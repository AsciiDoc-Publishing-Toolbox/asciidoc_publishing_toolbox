== About the Project

ADPT (AsciiDoc Publishing Toolbox) is a simple publishing tool based on
AsciiDoc.

The goal is to create a tool with an interface that's similar to the one saw in
various package managers (like Node's `npm` or PHP's `composer`) specialized in
the creation, management and publishing of documents.

== How to install

The installation process it's simple. You just need to ensure that Ruby is
installed on your system. Once done, you can install it from RubyGems using the
following command.

[source,shell]
---------------
# Depending on your system, this may require admin privileges
gem install asciidoc_publishing_toolbox
---------------
